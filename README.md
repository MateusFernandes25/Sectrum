This repository addresses the development of an information security chatbot in portuguese through fine-tuning of the Llama (open-source language model). It employs the QLora methodology to adjust the model's weights by retraining them using a database comprised of questions and answers related to information security. The model outperformed the Llama-7B model in Portuguese tasks overall, excelling particularly in Semantic Similarity and Textual Entailment activities. In question-answering tasks, our project approached the average performance of the Sabi√°-7B model.
